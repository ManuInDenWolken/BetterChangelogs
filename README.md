### What does BetterChangelogs?

BetterChangelogs is a plug-in for the popular minecraft server software
[Spigot](https://github.com/SpigotMC). The plug-in allows you to create, edit
(WIP) and view changelogs across your (BungeeCord based) minecraft server.
You're able to view this collection of created changelogs in a fancy graphical
interface in game.
